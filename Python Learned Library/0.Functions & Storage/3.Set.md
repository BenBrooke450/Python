## Characteristics of a Set

A set is a built-in data structure in Python with the following three characteristics.

 

 - **Unordered:** The items in the set are unordered, unlike lists, i.e., it will not maintain the order in which the items are inserted. The items will be in a different order each time when we access the Set object. There will not be any index value assigned to each item in the set.
 

 - **Unchangeable:** Set items must be immutable. We cannot change the set items, i.e., We cannot modify the items’ value. But we can add or remove items to the Set. A set itself may be modified, but the elements contained in the set must be of an immutable type.
 

 - **Unique:** There cannot be two items with the same value in the set.
 

 

 

 
```python
# create a set using {}

# set of mixed types intger, string, and floats

sample_set = {'Mark', 'Jessa', 25, 75.25}



print(sample_set)
# Output {25, 'Mark', 75.25, 'Jessa'}

 

 

# create a set using set constructor

# set of strings

book_set = set(("Harry Potter", "Angels and Demons", "Atlas Shrugged"))


print(book_set)
# output {'Harry Potter', 'Atlas Shrugged', 'Angels and Demons'}


print(type(book_set))
# Output class 'set'
```
 

 

 

 

## Create a set from a list

Also, set eliminating duplicate entries so if you try to create a set with duplicate items it will store an item only once and delete all duplicate items. Let’s create a set from an iterable like a list. We generally use this approach when we wanted to remove duplicate items from a list.

 
```python
# list with duplicate items
number_list = [20, 30, 20, 30, 50, 30]

# create a set from a list

sample_set = set(number_list)

 

print(sample_set)
# Output {50, 20, 30}
```
 

 

 

 

 

## Set Operations

All the operations that could be performed in a mathematical set could be done with Python sets. We can perform set operations using the operator or the built-in methods defined in Python for the Set.

 

The following table will summarize the set operations and the corresponding set method used.

 
| Operation            | Definition                                                                | Operator | Method                   |           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------ | --------- |
| Union                | All the items of both Sets will be returned. Only the duplicate items...  | \`       | \`                       | `union()` |
| Intersection         | Only the items common in both sets will be returned.                      | `&`      | `intersection()`         |           |
| Difference           | Return the unique elements in the first set which is not in the second... | `-`      | `difference()`           |           |
| Symmetric Difference | Return the elements of both sets which is not common.                     | `^`      | `symmetric_difference()` |           |

 

 






 
```python
"""

Given an array of strings words, return the words

 that can be typed using letters of the alphabet

  on only one row of American keyboard like the image below.

Note that the strings are case-insensitive,

both lowercased and uppercased of the same

letter are treated as if they are at the same row.

In the American keyboard:

the first row consists of the characters "qwertyuiop",

the second row consists of the characters "asdfghjkl", and

the third row consists of the characters "zxcvbnm".

 

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["Hello","Alaska","Dad","Peace"]

Output: ["Alaska","Dad"]

Explanation:

Both "a" and "A" are in the 2nd row of the American keyboard due to case insensitivity.

Example 2:

Input: words = ["omk"]

Output: []

Example 3:

Input: words = ["adsdf","sfd"]

Output: ["adsdf","sfd"

"""

def keyboard(list1 : list[str]):

    top = set([x for x in"qwertyuiop"])

    middle = set([x for x in "asdfghjkl"])

    bottom = set([x for x in "zxcvbnm"])

    list3 = []

    for words in list1:

        if set([x.lower() for x in words]) <= top:

            list3.append(words)

        elif set([x.lower() for x in words]) <= middle:

            list3.append(words)

        elif set([x.lower() for x in words]).issubset(bottom) is True:

            list3.append(words)

    return list3

 

 

 

print(keyboard(["Hello","Alaska","Dad","Peace"]))
