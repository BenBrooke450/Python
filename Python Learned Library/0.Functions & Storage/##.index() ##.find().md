# Difference Between `.index()` and `.find()` in Python

In Python, both the **`.index()`** and **`.find()`** methods are used to locate the position of a substring within a string.  
However, they behave differently when the substring is **not found** and also differ in applicability.

---

## `.index()` Method

- Returns the index of the **first occurrence** of a substring.  
- Raises a **`ValueError`** if the substring is not found.  
- Works on **strings, lists, and tuples**.  

### Example
```python
string = 'geeks for geeks'
result = string.index('for')
print("Substring 'for':", result) 
# Output: Substring 'for': 6

# Raises an error if not found
result = string.index('best')  
# ValueError: substring not found
````

---

## `.find()` Method

* Returns the index of the **first occurrence** of a substring.
* Returns **`-1`** if the substring is not found (instead of raising an error).
* Works only on **strings**.

### Example

```python
string = 'geeks for geeks'
result = string.find('for')
print("Substring 'for':", result) 
# Output: Substring 'for': 6

result = string.find('best')
print("Substring 'best':", result) 
# Output: Substring 'best': -1
```

## Key Differences

| Feature             | `.index()`                                  | `.find()`                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Error Handling**  | Raises `ValueError` if not found            | Returns `-1` if not found                |
| **Applicability**   | Works on strings, lists, and tuples         | Works only on strings                    |
| **Conditional Use** | Not safe in conditionals without try/except | Safe in conditionals (`if result != -1`) |

---

## Extra: Using `.index()` with `start` and `end`

The `.index()` method can also take optional arguments:

```python
string.index(substring, start, end)
```

* `start` → where to begin searching
* `end` → where to stop searching

### Example in Stock Price Iteration

```python
prices = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]
max_diff = 0
position_of_max = 0
position_of_min = 0
i = 0

for index, nums in enumerate(prices):
    try:
        index_start = position_of_max + i

        max_num = max(prices[position_of_max + i:])
        position_of_max = prices.index(max_num, index_start)

        min_num = min(prices[position_of_min:position_of_max])
        position_of_min = prices.index(min_num, position_of_min)

        i = 1
        diff = max_num - min_num
        if diff > max_diff:
            max_diff = diff

    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)
        break
```

Here:

* `index(max_num, index_start)` finds the **first occurrence of the maximum number**, starting from `index_start`.
* This helps in iterating through sequences where you need to repeatedly find new min/max values past a certain index.

---

## Quick Summary

* Use **`.index()`** when you expect the element to exist (or want to catch an exception).
* Use **`.find()`** when you want a **safe search** without exceptions.
* `.index()` is more versatile (works on lists/tuples as well as strings).
