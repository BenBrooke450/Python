# What is a Tuple?

A **tuple** is an **immutable, ordered collection** of items in Python. It’s similar to a list, but once created, it cannot be changed (no adding, removing, or modifying elements).

```python
t = (1, "apple", 3.14)
```

---

# Characteristics of Tuples

1. **Ordered** → elements maintain the order you put them in.

   ```python
   t = (1, 2, 3)
   print(t[0])  # 1
   ```

2. **Immutable** → you cannot reassign, append, or remove elements.

   ```python
   t = (1, 2, 3)
   # t[0] = 99  # ❌ TypeError
   ```

3. **Heterogeneous** → can contain different data types.

   ```python
   t = (1, "hello", [4, 5], (6, 7))
   ```

4. **Hashable (sometimes)** →

   * If all elements inside are immutable (e.g., numbers, strings, other tuples), the tuple can be used as a **dict key** or in a **set**.
   * If it contains mutable items (like lists), it’s not hashable.

   ```python
   t1 = (1, 2, 3)
   s = {t1}  # ✅ works

   t2 = (1, [2, 3])
   # s = {t2}  # ❌ TypeError
   ```

5. **Parentheses optional** → tuples can be created without parentheses.

   ```python
   t = 1, 2, 3
   print(t)  # (1, 2, 3)
   ```

---

# Creating Tuples

```python
t1 = (1, 2, 3)         # with parentheses
t2 = 1, 2, 3           # without parentheses
t3 = tuple([1, 2, 3])  # using constructor
t4 = ()                # empty tuple
t5 = (42,)             # single-element tuple (note the comma!)
```

---

# Accessing Elements

* Indexing

  ```python
  t = (10, 20, 30)
  print(t[1])   # 20
  ```
* Negative indexing

  ```python
  print(t[-1])  # 30
  ```
* Slicing

  ```python
  print(t[0:2])  # (10, 20)
  ```

---

# Tuple Operations

* **Concatenation**

  ```python
  t1 = (1, 2)
  t2 = (3, 4)
  print(t1 + t2)  # (1, 2, 3, 4)
  ```

* **Repetition**

  ```python
  print(t1 * 3)  # (1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)
  ```

* **Membership**

  ```python
  print(2 in t1)  # True
  ```

* **Iteration**

  ```python
  for item in (1, 2, 3):
      print(item)
  ```

* **Length**

  ```python
  len((1, 2, 3))  # 3
  ```

---

# Tuple Methods (only 2)

Tuples have limited methods compared to lists:

```python
t = (1, 2, 2, 3)
print(t.count(2))   # 2 (how many times 2 appears)
print(t.index(3))   # 3 (position of first occurrence of 3)
```

---

# Tuple Packing & Unpacking

* **Packing** → group values into a tuple automatically.

  ```python
  t = 1, "apple", 3.14
  ```

* **Unpacking** → extract values back into variables.

  ```python
  a, b, c = t
  print(a, b, c)  # 1 apple 3.14
  ```

* **Extended unpacking**

  ```python
  t = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  a, *b, c = t
  print(a)  # 1
  print(b)  # [2, 3, 4]
  print(c)  # 5
  ```

---

# Nesting & Heterogeneous Tuples

Tuples can contain **other tuples, lists, dicts, sets, etc.**

```python
t = (1, (2, 3), [4, 5], {"a": 1})
```

---

#  Common Use Cases

1. **Multiple return values** from functions

   ```python
   def minmax(nums):
       return min(nums), max(nums)

   lo, hi = minmax([3, 7, 1])
   ```

2. **Immutable data records** (like a lightweight struct).

3. **Dictionary keys** when multiple values are needed.

   ```python
   d = {("x", "y"): 42}
   ```

4. **Swapping variables easily**

   ```python
   a, b = 1, 2
   a, b = b, a
   ```

---

# Performance Notes

* Tuples are **slightly faster** than lists for iteration and lookups, because they are immutable.
* Immutability = safer when you want **constant data**.
* Lists are better if you need to **modify** frequently.

---

 **Summary:**

* Tuples = ordered, immutable, can hold mixed types.
* Support indexing, slicing, iteration, concatenation, repetition.
* Only two methods: `.count()`, `.index()`.
* Great for packing/unpacking values, returning multiple results, using as dictionary keys.
