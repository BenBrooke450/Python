# Backtracking

Backtracking is a **recursive problem-solving technique** used to build a solution incrementally and undo ("backtrack") choices that don’t lead to a valid or optimal solution.

It tries all possible paths, and if a path doesn't work, it goes back (or “backtracks”) to try the next option.




# Example 1

#### In this example it's important to understand the difference between taking the path through the recursion and not.

```python
nums = [1,2,3]
def backtrack(start, path):
    print()
    print("------ENTER BACKTRACK--------")
    print("TRYING", f"Start: {start}, End_len: {len(nums)}")
    print()
    for i in range(start, len(nums)):
        print(f"append: {[nums[i]]}      Start: {start}, End_len: {len(nums)}")
        path.append(nums[i])
        print("Path:  ",path)


        backtrack(i + 1, path)
        print()
        print("-----DROP OUT----- :",f"Start: {start+1}, End_len: {len(nums)}")
        print()

        print(f"Path before drop {path}")
        path.pop()
        print(f"Path after drop {path}")
        print()
        
        
        
        

------ENTER BACKTRACK--------
TRYING Start: 0, End_len: 3

append: [1]      Start: 0, End_len: 3
Path:   [1]

------ENTER BACKTRACK--------
TRYING Start: 1, End_len: 3

append: [2]      Start: 1, End_len: 3
Path:   [1, 2]

------ENTER BACKTRACK--------
TRYING Start: 2, End_len: 3

append: [3]      Start: 2, End_len: 3
Path:   [1, 2, 3]

------ENTER BACKTRACK--------
TRYING Start: 3, End_len: 3


#### HERE WE HAVE REACHED THE MAX POINT AND THE INTERATION HAS FAILED CAUSING THE RETURN


-----DROP OUT----- : Start: 3, End_len: 3

Path before drop [1, 2, 3]

```

#### We don't pop the last element here, because we have taken the path through the recursion, when it failes we go back to the previous path which is simply [1,2] and then we pop again as we retuned 

```python

Path after drop [1, 2]


-----DROP OUT----- : Start: 2, End_len: 3

Path before drop [1, 2]
Path after drop [1]

append: [3]      Start: 1, End_len: 3
Path:   [1, 3]

------ENTER BACKTRACK--------
TRYING Start: 3, End_len: 3


-----DROP OUT----- : Start: 2, End_len: 3

Path before drop [1, 3]
Path after drop [1]


-----DROP OUT----- : Start: 1, End_len: 3

Path before drop [1]
Path after drop []

append: [2]      Start: 0, End_len: 3
Path:   [2]

------ENTER BACKTRACK--------
TRYING Start: 2, End_len: 3

append: [3]      Start: 2, End_len: 3
Path:   [2, 3]

------ENTER BACKTRACK--------
TRYING Start: 3, End_len: 3


-----DROP OUT----- : Start: 3, End_len: 3

Path before drop [2, 3]
Path after drop [2]


-----DROP OUT----- : Start: 1, End_len: 3

Path before drop [2]
Path after drop []

append: [3]      Start: 0, End_len: 3
Path:   [3]

------ENTER BACKTRACK--------
TRYING Start: 3, End_len: 3


-----DROP OUT----- : Start: 1, End_len: 3

Path before drop [3]
Path after drop []
```



## Key Line:

```python
for i in range(start, len(nums)):
```

This for loop controls when recursion happens. If start >= len(nums), then:

 - **range(start, len(nums)) becomes an empty range**

 - **So the loop does not execute**

 - **Therefore, nothing inside the loop runs — and the function returns automatically (backtracks)**

Loop never runs (range(3, 3)), so the function exits

That’s the return

Then .pop() is called to remove 3 → backtrack!

Excellent question again 👏 — and now you’re asking the *deep* conceptual one:


<br><br><br><br>

> “What happens if I don’t take the list (`path`) into the recursion, and instead only pass the pointer or current index?”

Let’s unpack that carefully, because it changes the **entire nature of recursion** and **how state is maintained**.

---

## 🧩 Original: list *passed down* the recursion

Here’s your version again:

```python
nums = [1,2,3]

def backtrack(start, path):
    for i in range(start, len(nums)):
        path.append(nums[i])
        backtrack(i + 1, path)
        path.pop()

backtrack(0, [])
```

### How it behaves

* Each recursive call *shares and mutates* the same `path` list.
* The append/pop pattern ensures the same list object tracks the *current path*.
* The recursion tree looks like this:

```
[]
 ├── [1]
 │    ├── [1,2]
 │    │    └── [1,2,3]
 │    └── [1,3]
 └── [2]
      └── [2,3]
           └── [3]
```

Each `backtrack` call represents a “branch” that can grow (append) and shrink (pop).

---

## 🧩 Now imagine: you *don’t* carry the list — only the pointer (index)

Let’s say you did this:

```python
nums = [1,2,3]

def backtrack(start):
    for i in range(start, len(nums)):
        print(nums[i])
        backtrack(i + 1)

backtrack(0)
```

### What happens now

* You’re no longer carrying a list (`path`).
* You print or process *individual elements*.
* Each call only knows its **current position**, not the path taken to reach it.

So the output looks like this:

```
1
2
3
2
3
3
```

and not structured combinations.

That’s because nothing is keeping track of “what led to this point” —
each recursion just says “here’s the next element,” not “here’s the whole path so far.”

---

### If you *simulate* the same recursion but rebuild path at each step

You could still build the path locally (without mutating the same list) like this:

```python
def backtrack(start, path):
    for i in range(start, len(nums)):
        new_path = path + [nums[i]]  # new list each time
        print(new_path)
        backtrack(i + 1, new_path)
```

Now `path` is *not shared* between calls — every call owns its own list.

### Output:

```
[1]
[1, 2]
[1, 2, 3]
[1, 3]
[2]
[2, 3]
[3]
```

Same logical result, but no `pop()` needed.

---

## Key difference explained

| Version               | What’s Passed        | Shared State? | Needs pop()? | Memory Use | Notes                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| **Your version**      | Same `path` list     | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Yes        | Low        | Classic backtracking style |
| **Copy-on-recursion** | New list each call   | ❌ No          | ❌ No         | Higher     | Simpler mentally           |
| **Pointer-only**      | Just index (`start`) | ❌ No          | ❌ No         | Lowest     | Can’t reconstruct path     |

---

## Intuitive analogy

Think of it like a trail in a maze:

* **Original (`path` shared)**: you walk with a notepad, writing down each turn (`append`) and erasing when backtracking (`pop`).
* **Copy each time (`path + [x]`)**: you make a photocopy of your notepad at every junction — more memory, but each copy is independent.
* **Pointer-only (`start`)**: you walk without writing anything — you know where you are, but not how you got there.

---

## TL;DR

If you only carry the *pointer* (like `start`) and don’t take the list (`path`):

* You **lose memory of the path** you took to get there.
* You can still recurse through indices, but you can’t build combinations or sequences.
* To reconstruct combinations, you must either:

  * Carry a shared `path` (and backtrack with `pop()`), **or**
  * Create a new list each recursive call (`path + [nums[i]]`).

# Example 2


```python
def minPathSum(grid: list[list[int]]) -> int:
    cols = len(grid[0])
    rows = len(grid)
    path = []
    sums = []

    def dfs(r, c):
        # if out of bounds
        if r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols:
            return

        # add current cell
        path.append(grid[r][c])

        # if we reached bottom-right, record path sum
        if r == rows - 1 and c == cols - 1:
            sums.append(sum(path))
        else:
            # move right
            dfs(r, c + 1)
            # move down
            dfs(r + 1, c)

        # backtrack
        path.pop()

    dfs(0, 0)   # always start top-left

    return min(sums)


print(minPathSum([[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]))
```


Absolutely! Let’s go **step by step** and see exactly how recursion and `path.pop()` work together in your `minPathSum` function. We’ll use your example grid:

```
grid = [
 [1, 3, 1],
 [1, 5, 1],
 [4, 2, 1]
]
```

---

### Step 0 — Initial state

```python
path = []
sums = []
dfs(0, 0)
```

* We start at the top-left: `r = 0, c = 0`.
* `path = []`

---

### Step 1 — Visit (0,0)

```python
path.append(grid[0][0])  # append 1
```

* `path = [1]`
* Not bottom-right, so we recurse **right** first: `dfs(0, 1)`

---

### Step 2 — Visit (0,1)

```python
path.append(grid[0][1])  # append 3
```

* `path = [1, 3]`
* Not bottom-right → recurse **right**: `dfs(0, 2)`

---

### Step 3 — Visit (0,2)

```python
path.append(grid[0][2])  # append 1
```

* `path = [1, 3, 1]`
* Not bottom-right → try **right**: `dfs(0, 3)` → **out of bounds**, returns.
* Then try **down**: `dfs(1, 2)`

---

### Step 4 — Visit (1,2)

```python
path.append(grid[1][2])  # append 1
```

* `path = [1, 3, 1, 1]`
* Not bottom-right → recurse right: `dfs(1,3)` → out of bounds → returns.
* Then recurse down: `dfs(2,2)`

---

### Step 5 — Visit (2,2) → Bottom-right

```python
path.append(grid[2][2])  # append 1
```

* `path = [1, 3, 1, 1, 1]`
* Bottom-right reached → compute sum: `sum(path) = 7`
* Append to `sums`: `sums = [7]`

---

### Step 6 — Backtrack from (2,2)

```python
path.pop()
```

* Remove last element (1) from `path`
* `path = [1, 3, 1, 1]`
* Control returns to the call at (1,2)

---

### Step 7 — Backtrack from (1,2)

```python
path.pop()
```

* Remove last element (1)
* `path = [1, 3, 1]`
* Control returns to the call at (0,2)
* Now DFS explores other directions (down already tried, right already done) → backtrack again

---

### Step 8 — Backtrack from (0,2)

```python
path.pop()
```

* Remove last element (1)
* `path = [1, 3]`
* Control returns to the call at (0,1)
* Now explore **down**: `dfs(1,1)`

---

### Step 9 — DFS explores new path (0,1 → 1,1)

```python
path.append(grid[1][1])  # append 5
```

* `path = [1, 3, 5]`
* And recursion continues similarly…

---

### 🔑 How `pop()` works

* **Every recursive call has its own “stack frame”**, but they **share the same `path` list**.
* `.append()` adds a value as you go deeper.
* When a call finishes exploring all options from that cell, `.pop()` **removes the last element**, restoring `path` to the state before this cell was added.
* This **undoes the move**, allowing other branches to explore without leftover values.

Think of it like:

```
path = []  # start
dfs(0,0)  # append 1
  dfs(0,1)  # append 3
    dfs(0,2)  # append 1
      dfs(1,2)  # append 1
        dfs(2,2)  # append 1, reached end, sum=7
        pop()  # remove last 1
      pop()  # remove 1 from (1,2)
    pop()  # remove 1 from (0,2)
  pop()  # remove 3 from (0,1)
pop()  # remove 1 from (0,0)
```

* At each pop, the **list returns to the previous state**, allowing DFS to explore **all possible paths**.

---

### ✅ Final Result

All paths from top-left to bottom-right are explored, sums collected, and the **minimum path sum** is returned:

```
print(minPathSum([[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]))  # Output: 7
```
