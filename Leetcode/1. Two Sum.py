"""Given an array of integers nums and an
integer target, return indices of the two
numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have
exactly one solution, and you may not use
the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]"""
