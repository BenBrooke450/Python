"""

Given a non-negative integer x, return the
square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer.
 The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.


Example 1:

Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
Example 2:

Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and
since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.

"""So basically we are halfing the list everytime by 
  changing the low and high points from which we divide by 2
  
  If we have a list of say list = [1,2,3...,10]
    
    we first find the length which is = 10 - 1 = 9 (as python starts at 0)
    
    we find the mid point which is mid = (high + low) // 2  =>  
        (0+9)//2 which is 4 (is the index position, it would be 4.5 but we used //)
    
    so let's say we are looking for target of 3
    
    1. is 0 <= 9, yes that is correct so we start 
    
    2. list[mid] list[4] which is equal to 5 and the target is 3
    
    3. 5 is bigger then 3, so we (high = mid - 1) 4 - 1 = 3, 
         so now our high point is 3
    
    4. now we have index positions of low is 0 and high is 3,
         is low smaller or equal to 3, lower so we continue.
    
    5. mid = (high + low) // 2 
         mid = (3 + 0) // 2   =>    mid = 1
       
    6. so now our mid = 1, so list1[1] = 2
          is 2 less or bigger then 3 our target, less, so
          low = mid + 1   =>   low = 1 + 1
          so low = 2
    
    7. now we have low on 2 and high on 3,
        is low <= high, yea so we continue
    
    8. mid = (high + low) // 2
         mid = (3 + 2) // 2     =>    mid = 2
    
    9. list[mid]   =>   list[2] = 3
        which is list[mid] == target 
        sooo there we have it 
        index of 2 getÂ´s you your target
